In the field of oncology, the efficient categorization of biomedical text documents is crucial for accelerating research and the development of treatments. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of various transformer models—such as BART, GPT-2, RoBERTa, BERT, and BioBERT—using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), and Large Language Models (LLMs) for classifying cancer-related documents into specific categories, including Thyroid Cancer, Colon Cancer, and Lung Cancer. The models leverage advanced pre-training methods to handle the complex language and technical terminology found in biomedical texts. Among the models tested, GPT-2 achieves the highest performance, with an F1-score of 0.58, outperforming the other transformer models. This classification capability not only enhances the effectiveness of information retrieval but also establishes a robust framework for integrating Big Data into oncology and healthcare studies, facilitating rapid decision-making processes. The success of these models in automating the sorting of vast biomedical datasets underscores their potential for broader applications in clinical research, diagnostics, and personalized treatment strategies, where timely access to relevant information is essential.
